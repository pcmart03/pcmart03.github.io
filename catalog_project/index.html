<p>
  The catalog app is a project I built as a part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree. The task was to build an app using Flask that allowed an authenticated user to perform basic CRUD operations on items across a variety of categories in the catalog's database. My version also allows users to upload files to the catalog (We had the option to simply link to external image files). We were also required to require api endpoints that returned JSON data. The focus of the project was on the backend, so I kept it simple for the front and used the Foundation framework.

  The live version of the app is currently hosted on an Ubuntu instance on Amazon EC2. It uses PostgreSql for the database.
