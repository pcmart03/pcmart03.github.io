<p>I originally joined the Office of Financial Research digital media team as a writer. My company had been contracted to provide support in the development of <a href="https://www.financialresearch.gov/">the Office’s website</a>. My job was to write copy where needed. The task turned out to be smaller than everyone had thought. I completed it in about two weeks.</p>

<p>Hoping to hold the position for more than a month, I found other ways to be helpful. Prior to launching the site, I oversaw the efforts to fix hundreds of content errors created in the migration to Jekyll. After site launch, I became the web producer, overseeing the publication of new content to the site. Since then, I’ve taken on other duties as needed. Some of my duties have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Editing pdf's to meet 508 accessibility requirements</li>
  <li>Analyzing requirements for a CMS system</li>
  <li>Developing a workflow for content publication in Jira</li>
  <li>Preparing monthly website perforance reports using Google Analytics</li>
  <li>Writing documentation and user guides in confluence</li>
  <li>Migrating content from Jekyll to Drupal</li>
</ul>

<p>After I became more comfortable coding, I took on some development projects. The most complicated project, was writing a node script for converting Bibtex files to HTML according the OFR's internal style guide. More recently, I rebuilt <a href="https://www.financialresearch.gov/staff/">the senior leadership page</a>, and built landing pages for the site's "Programs" section.</p>
